# About

~~An extremely basic external csgo cheat using imgui and winapi, alongside basic memory reading and writing practices~~

Due to the global release of  [CS2](https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2), CS:GO has been shut down.

So because of this, until widespread knowledge regarding CS2 and its vulnerabilities, this source no longer works, the repo will still be up and [compiled versions](https://github.com/ridhwan2/imgui-external-csgo/releases) are available likewise.

Thanks to anyone who learned something or perhaps just wanted to use the cheat, but don't worry, if the memory class gets updated and offsets become easily avaliable i'll be sure to update it and release it again.
