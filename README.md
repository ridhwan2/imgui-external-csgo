# About

~~An extremely basic external csgo cheat using imgui and winapi, alongside basic memory reading and writing practices~~

Due to the global release of  [CS2](https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2), CS:GO has been shut down.

So because of this, until widespread knowledge regarding CS2 and its vulnerabilities, this source no longer works, the repo will still be up and [compiled versions](https://github.com/ridhwan2/imgui-external-csgo/releases) are available likewise.

For those curious, this is because the [GetModuleAddress](https://github.com/ridhwan2/imgui-external-csgo/blob/main/cheat/memory.h#L48) and subsequently, [ReadMemory](https://github.com/ridhwan2/imgui-external-csgo/blob/main/cheat/memory.h#L74), and [WriteMemory](https://github.com/ridhwan2/imgui-external-csgo/blob/main/cheat/memory.h#L83) functions no longer work in the memory class. Until cazz or someone else updates it there's really not much I can do.
