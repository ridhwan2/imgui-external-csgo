~~An extremely basic external csgo cheat using imgui and winapi, alongside basic memory reading and writing practices~~

Due to the global release of  [CS2](https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2), CS:GO has been shut down.

So because of this, until widespread knowledge regarding CS2 and its vulnerabilites, this source no longer works, the source will still be up and compiled versions are still availible likewise.

bye, bye and i wish you the best in your journey!
